# Data
For the data on arrears and debt, I use the arrears on long-term debt outstanding from official 
and private creditors, which are provided by the World Bank’s International Debt Statistic 
database. The data on SBA/EFF programs and Paris Club debt restructurings or reliefs are 
obtained from the IMF Financial Data Query Tool and the Paris Club’s website, respectively.
